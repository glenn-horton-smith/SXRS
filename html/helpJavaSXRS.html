<H1>Help for Secure eXperiment Remote Shift connection helper</H1>

This tool will log you into a computer visible from your local
computer, and then optionally log through from there into computers
that may be visible only from the first login computer, e.g.,
computers on a local net behind an NAT or firewall.  At the same time,
it will configure ssh tunnels which allow you to connect to vncservers
on the remote network.  You may use this to connect to graphical user
interfaces on computers used for running a data acquisition system for
a scientific experiment.

<H3>What to do:</H3>

Normally, all you need to do is make sure the first input field shows
your correct userid on the remote machine, then press the <INPUT
TYPE=SUBMIT VALUE="SSH #n"> buttons in sequence.  An external terminal
program will be launched (either xterm or putty by default).  If no
terminal appears, see the <A HREF=#Trouble>Trouble Shooting</A>
section below.  You enter passwords to log into your account, and
then (if your experiment requires it) into the appropriate accounts on
one or more computers visible from the first.

<P><I>After</I> you have successfully logged in to the final host, you
can press the <INPUT TYPE=SUBMIT VALUE="Start vncviewer"> button.
Enter the vncviewer password when prompted.  If the vncviewer client
doesn't start or produces an error, see the <A HREF=#Trouble>Trouble
Shooting</A> section.

<H3>Is there a way to get a ViewOnly VNC session?</H3>

Yes: check the ``VNC "view only mode"'' checkbox.

 <DT> Terminal doesn't start: 
    <DD><DL><DT>xterm+ssh: <DD>Are xterm and ssh on your default path?
          <DT>putty:
	     <DD><DL><DT>Running from Java web start on a Windows computer?
	             <DD>Contact a Windows-sympathetic person.
		     <DT>Running putty on a non-Windows computer or in
  non-standard way?  <DD>That's weird.  Don't do that.
                 </DL>

 <DT> Terminal starts but you can't log in:
      <DD> Resolve in the same way you would resolve any shell
login problem.  (E.g., e-mail the sysadmin if you've forgotten a
password.)

 <DT> vncserver won't start:
             <DD><DL>
	         <DT>Quick fix:
		     <DD>Start vncviewer manually, connecting to "localhost:9".
	         <DT>Running on a non-Windows platform?
	             <DD>Make sure vncviewer is on your path.
		 <DT>Running on a Windows platform?
		     <DD>Contact a Windows-sympathetic person.
	     </DL>

 <DT> vncserver starts but there is a problem:
     <DD> Investigate and correct the problem just as you would if you
     were on-site and couldn't get vncviewer to run on the machine.
     For example, if the vncserver is not running, start
     it.  Contact experts from the shift expert list for your
     experiment as needed.

 <DT> Don't know a password?
     <DD> Ask someone who knows.
